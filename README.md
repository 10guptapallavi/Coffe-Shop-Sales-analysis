The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Shop.

The data for this is available at https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=3&pageSize=5 

I extracted the data using Excel and transformed it in Power Query and cleaned the data as per need. Then I use Pivot Table and Dax functions to find some of the KPIâ€™s such as average order per person, Footfall at different store locations, Average bill per person and Total sales. Along with these KPIs, I also answered the following questions by visualising the data using different graphs and prepared a dynamic dashboard which could help stakeholders to get profitable business insights from it.

1. How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
   
3. Are there any peak times for sales activity?
   
5. What is the total sales revenue each month?
   
7. How do sales vary across different locations?
   
9. What are the top best 5 selling products in terms of quantity and revenue?
    
11. How do sales vary according to product category and type?
